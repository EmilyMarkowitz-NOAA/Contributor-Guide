Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
