Repositories on nmfs-opensci should have the following elements.

## Disclaimers and licenses

See the [template repo](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-blank) for the standard disclaimers to include on repositories. See the [NMFS GitHub Guidelines](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/GitHub-Guide/#github-repository-components) section on Readme, disclaimers and licenses. 

## Code of Conduct

All repositories created on nmfs-opensci will also have the NMFS Open Science Code of Conduct added to the repository; this happens automatically.

## NOAA branding

The nmfs-opensci GitHub organization is not intended for official NOAA communications and NOAA logos should not generally be used on repositories.
