## Contributor types

* admins (owners) can control all aspects of the organization and see (and control) all repository content (including private repos)
* org members: NOAA staff. Able to create public or private repositories.
* outside collaborators on org repos, NOAA staff. Can contribute via direct push to repositories
* outside collaborators on org repos, non-NOAA. Can contribute via pull requests to repositories
* public (not org members or outside collaborators on repos). Can interact with public repositories (see below).

## Ways to contribute

For public repositories, anyone can contribute issues and discussions (if enabled). Public repositories can also be forked and a pull-request submitted.

Only NOAA staff (with current NOAA email) can be an owner of a repository on nmfs-opensci or be a contributor with direct push permissions. Non-NOAA GitHub users can be added as contributors to public and private repositories, but with review turned on (i.e. no direct push access).

## NOAA users

NOAA staff who wish to contribute to nmfs-opensci

* need to have 2FA turned on
* should review the NMFS GitHub Checklist which outlines the types of material that are not allowed on GitHub

Then contact the nmfs-opensci admins to discuss the repository you would like to create and manage on nmfs-opensci.
